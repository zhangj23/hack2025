# Style Gallery Images

Place your style images in this directory.

## Quick Start

1. **Download images** from public domain sources (see `STYLE_GUIDE.md` in the root directory)
2. **Save them here** with descriptive names
3. **Restart the server** to see them in the gallery

## Recommended Sources

- **Retro**: Library of Congress, Internet Archive, Wikimedia Commons
- **Modern**: Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay

## File Naming

- Use descriptive names: `retro-1950s-ad.png`, `modern-geometric.jpg`
- Files with "retro" in the name are automatically categorized as retro
- All other files are categorized as modern

## Supported Formats

- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP

## Tips

- Square images (1:1 aspect ratio) display best
- 256x256 to 512x512 pixels work well with the AI model
- High contrast patterns produce better style transfer results
